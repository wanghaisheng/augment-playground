# Authentication Provider Fix

## Issue Description

The application was encountering the following error in the browser console:

```
Uncaught Error: useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider
    useAuth AuthContext.tsx:39
    ResourcesSection ResourcesSection.tsx:50
```

This error occurred because the `ResourcesSection` component was using the `useAuth` hook from `AuthContext.tsx`, but the `AuthProvider` component was not included in the application's component tree.

## Root Cause

In the `ResourcesSection.tsx` file, the component was using the `useAuth` hook:

```typescript
const { currentUser } = useAuth();
const userId = currentUser?.id;
```

However, the `AuthProvider` component was not included in the application's component tree in `App.tsx`. The `useAuth` hook throws an error when used outside of an `AuthProvider` context:

```typescript
export const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

## Solution

The solution was to add the `AuthProvider` component to the application's component tree in `App.tsx`:

1. Import the `AuthProvider` component:
   ```typescript
   import { AuthProvider } from '@/context/AuthContext';
   ```

2. Add the `AuthProvider` component to the component tree:
   ```typescript
   <SkeletonProvider>
     <AuthProvider>
       <BrowserRouter>
         <AppShell>
           {/* ... */}
         </AppShell>
       </BrowserRouter>
     </AuthProvider>
   </SkeletonProvider>
   ```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Files

- **src/App.tsx**
  - Added import for `AuthProvider` from `@/context/AuthContext`
  - Added `AuthProvider` component to the component tree, wrapping the `BrowserRouter` component

### 2. Benefits of the Fix

- **Fixed Error**: The "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error is resolved
- **Proper Context Usage**: Components that use the `useAuth` hook now have access to the authentication context
- **Consistent Architecture**: Follows the React context pattern for providing authentication state to components

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the error should no longer occur when accessing the `ResourcesSection` component. The component should now be able to access the authentication context through the `useAuth` hook.

## Future Considerations

When working with React context:

1. Always ensure that components using a context hook are wrapped with the corresponding provider component
2. Consider using a higher-order component or custom hook to check for context availability
3. Organize providers in a logical order, with more fundamental providers (like authentication) closer to the root
4. Document the required provider hierarchy for components that depend on multiple contexts

This approach ensures that context-dependent components will work correctly throughout the application.
