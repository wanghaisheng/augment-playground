# PandaHabit iOS Layout Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This document provides specific guidelines for implementing the PandaHabit application layout on iOS, addressing the current layout issues and ensuring alignment with Apple's design principles for games and mobile applications. The goal is to create a cohesive, well-structured layout that enhances the user experience while maintaining the app's unique Chinese-inspired game aesthetic.

## 1. Layout Structure Issues and Solutions

### 1.1 Current Layout Problems

- **Inconsistent spacing**: Varying margins and padding throughout the app
- **Misaligned elements**: Components not properly aligned to a consistent grid
- **Overcrowded screens**: Too many elements competing for attention
- **Poor visual hierarchy**: Lack of clear focus on important elements
- **Inconsistent component sizing**: UI elements with varying dimensions

### 1.2 Layout Structure Solutions

- **Implement a consistent grid system**: Use a 4pt base unit for all spacing
- **Apply standard safe areas**: Respect iOS safe areas for all content
- **Create component templates**: Standardize common UI elements
- **Establish clear visual hierarchy**: Define primary, secondary, and tertiary elements
- **Optimize for one-handed use**: Place key interactions in thumb-friendly zones

## 2. Game-Inspired Layout Framework

### 2.1 Screen Layers

Following Apple's game design guidelines, organize the UI into distinct layers:

1. **Game World Layer**: The primary content area showing the Panda and environment
2. **HUD Layer**: Status information, resources, and progress indicators
3. **Interaction Layer**: Primary interactive elements and controls
4. **Menu Layer**: Navigation and settings
5. **Overlay Layer**: Modals, popups, and temporary information

### 2.2 Layout Grid System

- **Base Unit**: 4pt
- **Standard Spacing**: 
  - Compact: 8pt (2 units)
  - Standard: 16pt (4 units)
  - Generous: 24pt (6 units)
  - Section: 32pt (8 units)
- **Margins**:
  - Screen edge: 16pt
  - Safe area inset: Respect iOS system values
  - Content grouping: 8pt between related items

### 2.3 Component Sizing

- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt × 44pt for all interactive elements
- **Icons**: 
  - Primary: 28pt × 28pt
  - Secondary: 24pt × 24pt
  - Tertiary: 20pt × 20pt
- **Text Fields**: Minimum height of 44pt
- **Buttons**: 
  - Primary: 48pt height
  - Secondary: 44pt height
  - Tertiary/Icon buttons: 44pt × 44pt

## 3. Page-Specific Layout Guidelines

### 3.1 Home Page / Panda Habitat

**Current Issues**:
- Panda display area lacks clear boundaries
- Resource indicators scattered inconsistently
- Interactive elements placed without consideration for reach

**Solutions**:
- **Structure**:
  - Top 15% of screen: Resource HUD with consistent spacing
  - Middle 60% of screen: Panda habitat (main focus)
  - Bottom 25% of screen: Primary interaction buttons in arc formation
- **Component Placement**:
  - Resource indicators: Aligned horizontally with 16pt spacing
  - Panda: Centered in habitat area with clear visual boundary
  - Interaction buttons: Arranged in thumb-friendly arc pattern
  - Progress indicators: Bottom of screen, above navigation

### 3.2 Task List Page

**Current Issues**:
- Filter options take too much vertical space
- Task cards have inconsistent sizing
- Add task button placement varies

**Solutions**:
- **Structure**:
  - Top 10% of screen: Page title and back button
  - Next 10% of screen: Horizontal scrolling filter chips
  - Middle 70% of screen: Scrollable task list
  - Bottom 10% of screen: Fixed position add task button
- **Component Placement**:
  - Filter chips: Horizontal scroll with 8pt spacing
  - Task cards: Full width with 16pt margins, 16pt spacing between cards
  - Add button: Fixed to bottom-right, 16pt from edges

### 3.3 Panda Interaction Page

**Current Issues**:
- Unclear separation between panda view and interaction options
- Tab navigation inconsistently implemented
- Detail sections lack structure

**Solutions**:
- **Structure**:
  - Top 50% of screen: Panda display area
  - Middle 10% of screen: Tab navigation
  - Bottom 40% of screen: Content area for selected tab
- **Component Placement**:
  - Panda: Centered in display area
  - Interaction buttons: Positioned around panda with consistent spacing
  - Tab indicators: Equal width, full screen width
  - Tab content: Consistent padding (16pt) and component spacing (8pt)

### 3.4 Mood Check / Tea Room Page

**Current Issues**:
- Mood selection UI lacks clear visual structure
- Input areas have inconsistent sizing
- History view implementation varies

**Solutions**:
- **Structure**:
  - Top 15% of screen: Page title and mood selection
  - Middle 45% of screen: Reflection input area
  - Bottom 40% of screen: History timeline
- **Component Placement**:
  - Mood selectors: Equal-sized (60pt × 60pt), horizontal arrangement with 16pt spacing
  - Reflection input: Clearly defined card with 16pt padding
  - Submit button: Centered, 48pt height, 200pt minimum width
  - History items: Consistent card design with 16pt spacing

### 3.5 Profile / Settings Page

**Current Issues**:
- User info section lacks visual prominence
- Settings groups blend together
- Achievement display inconsistent

**Solutions**:
- **Structure**:
  - Top 25% of screen: User profile card

  - Profile card: 16pt margin, clear visual boundary
  - Statistics: 2×2 or 3×2 grid with equal cell sizing
  - Settings: Grouped list with 24pt section spacing, 16pt item spacing
  - Achievements: Horizontal scrolling cards, 3:2 aspect ratio

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 CSS Structure

- Create a base stylesheet with variables for:
  - Spacing units
  - Color palette
  - Typography scale
  - Component dimensions
- Implement utility classes for:
  - Margins and padding
  - Flexbox and grid layouts
  - Text styles
  - Common animations

### 4.2 Component Templates

Develop standardized components for:
- Cards (task, achievement, profile)
- Buttons (primary, secondary, icon)
- Input fields
- List items
- Tab navigation
- Modal windows

### 4.3 Responsive Considerations

- Implement layout adjustments for different iPhone models
- Use relative units (%, rem) for flexible scaling
- Test on smallest and largest supported devices
- Ensure touch targets remain accessible on all screen sizes

## 5. Implementation Checklist

For each page implementation, verify:

- [ ] All elements align to the 4pt grid system
- [ ] Spacing is consistent with the defined scale
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clearly guides attention
- [ ] Content remains within safe areas
- [ ] Components use standardized templates
- [ ] Layout adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
- [ ] Interactive elements are in thumb-friendly zones
- [ ] Traditional Chinese aesthetic is maintained

## 6. Testing Protocol

- Test layouts on multiple device sizes (iPhone SE to iPhone Pro Max)
- Verify proper display in both light and dark mode
- Check layout with different text size settings
- Validate touch target accessibility
- Test one-handed usability
- Verify layout with Chinese and English text
