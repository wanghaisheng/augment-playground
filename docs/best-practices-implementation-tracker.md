- [x] Replaced input with EnhancedInput in TaskReminderForm.tsx
- [x] Replaced raw buttons with Button components in TaskReminderForm.tsx
- [x] Replaced textarea with EnhancedTextArea in MoodTracker.tsx
- [x] Replaced range input with EnhancedInput in MoodTracker.tsx

### In Progress
- [ ] Replace direct HTML elements in other components:
  - [ ] TaskForm.tsx
  - [ ] SocialChallengeForm.tsx
  - [ ] ReflectionModule.tsx
- [ ] Ensure consistent use of Button, LoadingSpinner, ErrorDisplay, etc.

## Data Refresh and Partial Updates

- [x] Applied useOptimizedDataRefresh to StoreItemList.tsx
- [x] Applied useOptimizedDataRefresh to LuckyPointsDisplay.tsx

### In Progress
- [ ] Replace full page refreshes in other components
- [ ] Ensure all components use optimized data refresh hooks

## React Hooks Optimization

### Completed
- [x] Created useStableCallback hook for callback function stability
- [x] Created useAsyncEffect hook for complex effect logic
- [x] Created callback-types.ts with type definitions for callbacks
- [x] Created react-hooks-best-practices.md with guidelines for hooks usage
- [x] Applied useAsyncEffect to AchievementUnlockNotification.tsx
- [x] Applied useStableCallback to AchievementUnlockNotification.tsx
- [x] Applied useOptimizedDataRefresh to StoreItemList.tsx
- [x] Applied useStableCallback to StoreItemList.tsx
- [x] Applied useAsyncEffect to StoreItemList.tsx

### In Progress
- [ ] Fix useEffect dependency arrays in other components
- [ ] Optimize callback function stability in other components
- [ ] Extract complex Effect logic in other components
- [ ] Improve callback function type safety in other components

## Next Steps

1. Continue applying React Hooks optimizations to components:
   - Focus on components with complex async logic for useAsyncEffect
   - Focus on components with callback stability issues for useStableCallback
   - Focus on components with data refresh needs for useOptimizedDataRefresh

2. Continue improving multilingual support:
   - Apply mergeLabelBundles to more components
   - Create proper label interfaces for components
   - Update components to use useComponentLabels

3. Continue replacing direct HTML elements with common components:
   - TaskForm.tsx - replace textarea with EnhancedTextArea
   - SocialChallengeForm.tsx - replace textarea with EnhancedTextArea
   - ReflectionModule.tsx - replace textarea with EnhancedTextArea

4. Improve documentation:
   - Add JSDoc comments to all components
   - Document all parameters in component interfaces

5. Ensure consistent data refresh handling:
   - Identify components using full page refreshes
   - Replace with useOptimizedDataRefresh and triggerDataRefresh

6. Optimize React hooks usage:
   - Audit components for useEffect dependency issues
   - Replace any callbacks using useCallback with useStableCallback where appropriate
   - Use typed event handlers from callback-types.ts
