This is a placeholder file for the background music directory.

In a real implementation, this directory would contain actual audio files in MP3 format.
For testing purposes, you can download free background music from websites like:

- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/music/)
- Free Music Archive (https://freemusicarchive.org/)
- Bensound (https://www.bensound.com/)

Then place them in this directory with the appropriate filenames as defined in the backgroundMusic.ts file.

Example filenames:
- bamboo_forest.mp3
- meditation_ambient.mp3
- morning_nature.mp3
- evening_calm.mp3
- traditional_guzheng.mp3
- traditional_flute.mp3
- traditional_ensemble.mp3
- spring_theme.mp3
- summer_theme.mp3
- autumn_theme.mp3
- winter_theme.mp3

Make sure the audio files are:
- In MP3 format
- Optimized for web (smaller file size)
- Properly loopable for seamless playback
- Between 3-5 minutes in length
