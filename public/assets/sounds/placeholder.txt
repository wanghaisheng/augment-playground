This is a placeholder file for the sounds directory.

In a real implementation, this directory would contain actual audio files in MP3 format.
For testing purposes, you can download free sound effects from websites like:

- Freesound (https://freesound.org/)
- Mixkit (https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
- ZapSplat (https://www.zapsplat.com/)

Then place them in this directory with the appropriate filenames as defined in the sound.ts file.

Example filenames:
- button_click.mp3
- success.mp3
- error.mp3
- achievement.mp3
- level_up.mp3
- task_complete.mp3
- reward_legendary.mp3

For background music, place files in the music subdirectory with filenames like:
- bamboo_forest.mp3
- meditation_ambient.mp3
- traditional_guzheng.mp3
